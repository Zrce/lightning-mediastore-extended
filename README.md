# lightning-media-store-extended

This is based on Michael Rhee's 
- https://github.com/blastshielddown/lapp-crash-course
- https://medium.com/@rheedio/a-crash-course-in-lightning-app-development-part-deux-51a8e48a4540

This code is extending the original application with:
- Dynamic payment verifications so the user doesnâ€™t have to click a button to check their invoice 
- QR codes for payment
- some additional changes were made, but they don't add functionality 

I recorded two videos about the current process of extending and running this bitcoin lightning application 
1) Running the basic application of Michael Rhee
